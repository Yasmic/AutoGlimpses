        "- On a single-core machine, threads do not execute truly in parallel. Instead, what gives the illusion of parallelism is something called \"time-slicing\" or \"preemptive multitasking.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- Context Switching: The operating system rapidly switches between running threads. It gives each thread a little \"slice\" of time to execute. When a thread's time slice is up, its current state (context) is saved, and the CPU starts executing another thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Concurrency vs. Parallelism: It's important to differentiate between concurrency and parallelism. Concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once (which can be achieved through mechanisms like context switching), while parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once (which requires multiple cores or processors).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Benefits on Single Core: Even on a single-core machine, using threads can be beneficial. For instance, if one thread is waiting for I/O (like reading a file or waiting for a network response), another thread can use the CPU. This way, the CPU isn't idly waiting and can be used more efficiently.\n",
        "- Overhead: Using multiple threads introduces overhead because of the need for context switches, synchronization mechanisms, etc. On a single-core machine, overusing threads (especially for tasks that are purely computational) can even lead to worse performance due to this overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Languages & Libraries: In C++ specifically, the standard <thread> library gives you tools to create and manage threads. But the behavior in terms of how these threads are scheduled and executed depends on the operating system's scheduler.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cooperative Multitasking: This is another form of multitasking where tasks yield control periodically or when idle to enable multiple tasks to run in a single-threaded environment. This approach depends more on the tasks being well-behaved and giving up control often."
